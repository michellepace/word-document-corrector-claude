## Example Files
To get a view of what corrections this Notebook makes, view the below files. What is interesting too is to open the input file in Word and see how many corrections it missed compared to the Output file from the notebook.
- Input file: [MyWordDoc.docx](https://michellepace.github.io/word-document-corrector-claude/example-files/MyWordDoc.docx) - sample Word document with various errors.
- Output file: [MyWordDoc.docx.PROCESSED.html](https://michellepace.github.io/word-document-corrector-claude/example-files/MyWordDoc.docx.PROCESSED.html) - corrected version with changes highlighted.

2. **Pre-processing:** Extracts text from Word, converts to markdown, splits into chunks
3. **Processing:** Sends chunks to Claude for correction
4. **Post-Processing:** Reassembles chunks, creates HTML output
5. **Testing:** Evaluates output, tests prompt, and tests code
