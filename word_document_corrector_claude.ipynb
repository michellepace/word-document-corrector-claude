I do this so I can send these smaller chunks to Claude for correction, one by one. This picture explains it very well:\n",

So, if I sent all the markdown text at once, a lot of the content would be left out in Claude's corrected reply.\n",
        "\n",
        "Small chunks are also quite handy. They make it easy to compare the \"original chunk\" with the \"processed chunk\" I get back from Claude. For instance, I can quickly spot if the semantic meaning of the corrected chunk has changed compared to the original chunk. It's much easier to notice oddities with little chunks than one enormous chunk. Plus, if something goes wrong, I'd rather have a small chunk fail than the entire document.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Why I chunked with characters (not tokens)\n",
        "\n",
        "I chose to split the text into chunks based on character count rather than tokens. For instance, “split the document into chunks each about 1,000 characters long.” When working with large language models, it is far more common to split text by tokens, not character count. If you're curious as to why I chose characters (instead of tokens), here's the explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "**First, let's talk about \"tokens.\"** They're just a way to measure text size, like kilograms measure a person's weight. But here's the twist: while a kilogram is the same everywhere, tokens aren't. Each large language model has its own way of counting text size using its own “tokeniser”. So \"87 Anthropic Claude tokens\" isn't the same amount of text as \"87 OpenAI GPT tokens\". Language models don’t measure the size of text by counting words or characters like we do.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that Claude is limited to replying with no more than 4,096 \"Anthropic tokens”, it would obviously make sense to split text by counting tokens. So why did I use characters instead?\n",
        "\n",
        "I got a bit lazy. My text is in Markdown format, and I didn't want to break apart Markdown elements accidentally when splitting the text into chunks. I found a library that splits Markdown text while respecting its structure. The problem is that this library only allows me to specify target chunk size in characters (not tokens). Still, I thought it a better workaround than writing more code. As in, I thought doing rough math estimates was easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How I determined my target chunk size (in characters)\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine my ideal chunk size (in characters), I first analysed token, character, and word counts on random text I generated with Claude. I used the Anthropic Tokeniser to count the tokens.\n",
        "\n",

        "<figure>\n",
        "  <figcaption>Estimating Conversion: Between words, characters, and Anthropic Tokens</figcaption>\n",

        "\n",
        "Then I did some math:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Claude can return a maximum of 4,096 tokens per chunk\n",
        "1. My equation: (prompt size) + (chunk size) + (wiggle room for corrections) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "1. Anthropic’s tokeniser measured my prompt (without a chunk attached) at 405 tokens.\n",
        "1. I decided 500 tokens for correction wiggle room would be enough.\n",
        "1. So: (405 tokens) + (chunk size) + (500 tokens) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "1. This means that my chunk size must be no more than 3,191 tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "And now using the data above to approximate:\n",
        "\n",
        "- 3,191 tokens x 5.89 characters = 18,795 characters\n",
        "\n",
        "But hold on, 18,795 characters in English is about 2,565 words which is 5 pages in Microsoft Word. I want smaller chunks to pinpoint subtle changes more easily. In my prompt I instruct Claude to “make corrections but retain original meaning.” Having smaller chunks to compare means I can detect changes in meaning with more sensitivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**I chose 4,000 characters as my target chunk size because** this is about 545 words (just less than one page in Word) and about (4,000/5.89) 679 Anthropic tokens. Remember my wiggle of 500 tokens? This is about 400 words which is more than enough as I’m only sending Claude 545 words for correction anyhow. My numbers are rough approximations using the sample data above. But with a target chunk size of 4,000 characters (or 679 tokens) there are 2,512 tokens of room left anyhow:\n",
        "\n",
        "- So: (405 tokens) + (chunk size: 679 tokens) + (500 tokens) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "The only downside I see in using small chunks is a little more cost. Costs for API usage are calculated based on the number of tokens used, not per prompt. Because I’m sending more prompts than I need to, it just means I’m sending 405 tokens (i.e., the prompt measured without the chunk) more times than I have to as I'll be sending more chunks. That’s okay.\n",

How would I know if it's performing as well as Claude did? What if I have 20 large Word documents to correct? It wouldn't be practical to manually check each one. What if my document is in Italian? Should I assume Claude will perform as well, or should I have an automated way of testing it?

I generally look for scores above 80% to be confident Claude has preserved the original meaning while making corrections. A 70% score might indicate that the general topic is the same, but some details or nuances have changed. It's not necessarily bad, but it signals that a closer look at that chunk may be needed.\n",

That is why I wrote these tests – to automate my manual tests so I could tweak faster with more confidence.
