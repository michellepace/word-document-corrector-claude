        ">Elevate your Word document with AI-powered proofreading that goes beyond standard spell-check. This notebook uses Anthropic's [Claude Sonnet model](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) to scan your Word documents, catching subtle language and style errors that often slip past Microsoft Word. Whether you're writing in English, German, Italian, or French, it preserves your intended meaning while polishing your prose to perfection‚Äîeven for very large documents.\n",

For instance, I can quickly spot if the semantic meaning of the corrected chunk has changed compared to the original chunk.

For instance, ‚Äúsplit the document into chunks each about 1,000 characters long.‚Äù When working with large language models, it is far more common to split text by tokens, not character count. If you're curious as to why I chose characters (instead of tokens), here's the explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "**First, let's talk about \"tokens.\"** They're just a way to measure text size, like kilograms measure a person's weight. But here's the twist: while a kilogram is the same everywhere, tokens aren't. Each large language model has its own way of counting text size using its own ‚Äútokeniser‚Äù. So \"87 Anthropic Claude tokens\" isn't the same amount of text as \"87 OpenAI GPT tokens\". Language models don‚Äôt measure the size of text by counting words or characters like we do.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that Claude is limited to replying with no more than 4,096 \"Anthropic tokens‚Äù, it would obviously make sense to split text by counting tokens. So why did I use characters instead?\n",
        "\n",
        "I got a bit lazy. My text is in Markdown format, and I didn't want to break apart Markdown elements accidentally when splitting the text into chunks. I found a library that splits Markdown text while respecting its structure. The problem is that this library only allows me to specify target chunk size in characters (not tokens). Still, I thought it a better workaround than writing more code. As in, I thought doing rough math estimates was easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How I determined my target chunk size (in characters)\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine my ideal chunk size (in characters), I first analysed token, character, and word counts on random text I generated with Claude. I used the Anthropic Tokeniser to count the tokens.\n",

        "1. Claude can return a maximum of 4,096 tokens per chunk\n",
        "1. My equation: (prompt size) + (chunk size) + (wiggle room for corrections) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "1. Anthropic‚Äôs tokeniser measured my prompt (without a chunk attached) at 405 tokens.\n",
        "1. I decided 500 tokens for correction wiggle room would be enough.\n",
        "1. So: (405 tokens) + (chunk size) + (500 tokens) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "1. This means that my chunk size must be no more than 3,191 tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "And now using the data above to approximate:\n",
        "\n",
        "- 3,191 tokens x 5.89 characters = 18,795 characters\n",
        "\n",
        "But hold on, 18,795 characters in English is about 2,565 words which is 5 pages in Microsoft Word. I want smaller chunks to pinpoint subtle changes more easily. In my prompt I instruct Claude to ‚Äúmake corrections but retain original meaning.‚Äù Having smaller chunks to compare means I can detect changes in meaning with more sensitivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**I chose 4,000 characters as my target chunk size because** this is about 545 words (just less than one page in Word) and about (4,000/5.89) 679 Anthropic tokens. Remember my wiggle of 500 tokens? This is about 400 words which is more than enough as I‚Äôm only sending Claude 545 words for correction anyhow. My numbers are rough approximations using the sample data above. But with a target chunk size of 4,000 characters (or 679 tokens) there are 2,512 tokens of room left anyhow:\n",
        "\n",
        "- So: (405 tokens) + (chunk size: 679 tokens) + (500 tokens) <= 4,096 tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "The only downside I see in using small chunks is a little more cost. Costs for API usage are calculated based on the number of tokens used, not per prompt. Because I‚Äôm sending more prompts than I need to, it just means I‚Äôm sending 405 tokens (i.e., the prompt measured without the chunk) more times than I have to as I'll be sending more chunks.

        "I tested my prompt, and Claude was quite dependable in retaining original semantic meaning when doing corrections. However, I still wanted an automated way to check that this holds true for every Word document corrected. So, I set up three different ways to evaluate the corrected text against your original text. These provide confidence that Claude has enhanced your writing without changing its core message, structure, or content.\n",

        "1. **Document structure:** Are the headings and paragraphs still in the right place?\n",
        "1. **Document content - Word count:** Has the overall length changed dramatically?\n",

        "**\"Michelle, so much testing is overkill,\"** I hear you saying. I quite disagree, and here's why: Imagine I decide to switch to the free Meta Llama 3.1 model instead of Claude Sonnet. How would I know if it's performing as well as Claude did? What if I have 20 large Word documents to correct? It wouldn't be practical to manually check each one. What if my document is in Italian? Should I assume Claude will perform as well, or should I have an automated way of testing it? Lastly, just because I've thoroughly tested one document, that doesn't imply the same level of dependability for another as content varies vastly.\n",

        "\n",
        "<font color=\"#D97757\">This notebook, titled \"Fix Word Doc Claude,\" is an AI-powered proofreading tool that uses Anthropic's Claude Sonnet model to correct and enhance Word documents. It's designed to catch subtle language and style errors that often slip past Microsoft Word's spell-checker. The notebook can handle large documents (up to 42,000 words) in multiple languages, including English, German, Italian, and French.\n",
        "The notebook is structured into several main sections:</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "**About and Usage**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. <font color=\"#D97757\">**Setup** (Python libraries and configuration)\n",
        "1. **Pre-processing** (extracting text from Word, converting to markdown, splitting into chunks)\n",
        "1. **Processing** (sending chunks to Claude for correction)\n",
        "1. **Post-Processing** (reassembling chunks, creating HTML output)\n",
        "1. **Testing** (evaluating output, testing prompt, and testing code)</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "<font color=\"#D97757\">The notebook not only serves as a functional tool but also as a demonstration of how Claude can assist in creating complex tools with basic coding skills. It showcases the author's journey in AI development, highlighting the collaboration between a human with limited coding experience and an AI assistant.</font>\n",

        "**Quality Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. <font color=\"#D97757\">**Comprehensiveness:** The notebook is exceptionally detailed, covering all aspects from setup to testing. It provides a complete solution for document correction.\n",
        "1. **Educational Value:** The author explains each step thoroughly, making it accessible to non-technical users. The notebook serves as an excellent learning resource for AI-assisted development.\n",
        "1. **Code Quality:** The code is well-structured and commented. It includes error handling and user-friendly messages, showing attention to user experience.\n",
        "1. **Testing:** The notebook includes extensive testing, covering output evaluation, prompt testing, and code testing. This demonstrates a commitment to reliability and quality.\n",
        "1. **Innovation:** The project creatively uses Claude for both development assistance and as the core of the correction tool, showcasing innovative use of AI.\n",
        "1. **Documentation:** The notebook is well-documented, with clear explanations of each step, making it easy for others to understand and potentially adapt the code.\n",
        "1. **Reflective Learning:** The FAQ section provides valuable insights into the development process and lessons learned, adding depth to the project.</font>\n",
